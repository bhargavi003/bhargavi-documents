    sprint component id is not there in that then you have to create a folder by clicking on New  
    then in that you have to create individual trackers for your sprint by clicking on new then in that you have to create  
    ppt's for component every component should have 3 ppt's
    
    --one for screen shot ppt - rename it as ppt name following with component id
